# PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE 

If there is no name in the "LIST_SECTIONS.md" list that matches your request, write me about it in ISSUES before you send the pull request. Such an issue will be tagged as "New section".

The help announcement from a non-English source requires you to create a second Markdown file called "README-country_code.md", the Alpha-2 codes can be found on this [site](https://www.iban.com/country-codes). Previously, however, all information that is common to each README should be translated into the target language. However, this does not exempt you from writing the title and pull request description in English.

The person sending the Pull Request must:
- adapt to the scheme that already exists on the page
- make sure the pull request is not a duplicate of another pull request
- the pull request title must follow the "Action - What" scheme
where Action - Add, Change, Delete
where What - typo, Data in list, Section, Markdown file, section [section name] in README.md, etc.
- if the pull request is about adding new information, the pull request title should look like "Added Info - Section - Company/Site - Technology name (if any) - Until when"
- The pull request description should contain information on what kind of help the company expects and a link to the site
- If the entry is from announcer's site in a language other than English and entry will be added to non-English README, then you need to add the [country code](https://www.iban.com/country-codes) at the end of the pull request title.  

<p>If there is a situation that the same company needs help at the same time for the same technology, then we add the notification number at the end. If someone has previously sent a pull request with the same name for the first time, you have to add the number 2 at the end, and so on. Why? Let's assume that someone asks for continuous help which does not contain a specific date, but wants to catalog users for the same application according to different tasks, placing another ad on a different subpage or even a completely different page. **If both requests relate to the same application and the same date and the same company, but there is a request for a different kind of help from a different place, then you need to add another number to the pull request title.**</p>

### Good Examples

<p>I sent my first changes with Pull Request to show how it should look like. You have to rewind to the first Pull Requests sent.</p>

### When you don't know, how should look like a table for the first time
