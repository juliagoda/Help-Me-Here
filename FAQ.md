# FAQ  

> What happens when the last entry in a section disappears because all entries have already been deleted?

The section will be deleted until there is a new entry. The section name will be saved to the file "LIST_BRANCHES.md".  

> Is the submission of an application to take part in the competition considered?

No. Contests are not a direct support for technology development.  

> Do the job advertisements on which the existence of the company depends also count?

Accepted pull requests are for direct support, which consists of offering voluntary help. However, if someone receives an offer to work in a place where has participated voluntarily, it's another matter.  

> Are there any exceptions for sending pull request?

Yes, an entry will not be placed on the site if the ad comes from a site that deals with spam, pornography, theft, etc. In special cases the entry may also not appear if the ad comes from a site that is particularly toxic to users and/or collaborators. Of course this can be deduced from public content. Fortunately, however, these are quite rare situations, which are in a significant minority.  

> How are deadlines monitored?

A notification will be created somewhere to remind you of the end. At the end of the last day or the next day, the information will be checked again under the link if the deadline has not been extended, otherwise the information will be deleted. In case of omission, pull request with deletion of an entry is always welcome

> Will deleted entries go to another folder?

Outdated advertisements will not be archived due to too many of them after some time. In the future, however, history could be documented with the help of statistical tools, which would, for example, include the average time of help and continuous, application themes, IT department and many others.
