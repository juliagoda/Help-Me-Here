# Sections List   

Below is a list of sections in case you do not know what name to use. In order to know what section to name, you need to ask yourself what kind of technology it is. If a company develops software but asks for help in testing a database, then the section name will be "Database". We are not interested in the company's computer science field, but we want to know if we are able to help depending on the technology in question.
