# ISSUES TEMPLATE  

In case of submitted errors. You can report them in issues, they will be tagged as "bug". Such a report must describe it:
- what exactly it concerns (what and where)
- why it is a bug (if the problem does not concern an incorrect grammar or an outdated entry, because it is just obvious)   

### Good Examples  

"Inactive link in README.md in [section name] to [company name]"  
"Typo in LIST_SECTIONS.md in the description"  
"Typo in LIST_SECTIONS.md in the list"  
"Inadequate link in README.md in [section name] to [company name]"    

### Bad Examples  

"Bug"  
"Error"  
"Inactive link"  
"Not good section"  

#### Why?  

Imagine that you are in my place and in the place of other users. If someone reports you a bug written so generally, will you know what it is about? Assuming you put everything in the problem description, after some time searching for this content may be a big problem when there are many reports.
